The data source for this visualization can be downloaded [here](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#00-0000) as a xls/csv download within body of the page.

The javascript that generates the data tables based on user input was written by Rob Thompson [linkedIn/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robthompsoncolorado/)[gitHub](https://github.com/rob10thhuman) then adapted.

In development is a feature to extend interactivity by searching the BLS's beta [dataQuery](https://beta.bls.gov/dataQuery/) for an occupation category and then generating a database for that occupation category.
