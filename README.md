# Interactive Choropleth Map based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics
This is a version of an interactive choropleth map tutorial provided by [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/).

Using the BLS beta [dataQuery](https://beta.bls.gov/dataQuery/) as a starting point, the program then searches for an occupation category and then generates a database for that occupation category.
