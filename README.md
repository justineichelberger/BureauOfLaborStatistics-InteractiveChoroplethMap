The source data for this project can be found [here](https://www.bls.gov/oes/special.requests/oesm20nat.zip).

The javascript that generates the data tables based on user input was written by Rob Thompson [(linkedIn)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robthompsoncolorado/) then adapted.

In development is a feature to extend interactivity by searching the BLS's beta [dataQuery](https://beta.bls.gov/dataQuery/) for an occupation category and then generating a database for that occupation category.
